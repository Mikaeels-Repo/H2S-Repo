# Generative AI for demystifying legal documents
An AI-powered web application that demystifies complex legal documents. This tool allows users to upload, summarize, and query legal text in plain language, bridging the gap between dense jargon and clear understanding.
The application provides a complete workflow for document analysis. It begins with secure user login and registration handled by Auth0. Users can then upload files or scanned images, with multilingual text extraction powered by Tesseract OCR.
At its core, the platform leverages the Google Gemini API to generate simplified summaries and allows users to ask specific, contextual questions about the text through an interactive chatbot.
